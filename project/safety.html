        <p>It is essential that you plan for safety when hiking in Arizona.</p>
        <h2>Stay Hydrated</h2>
        <p>Carry at least 1 liter of water per hour of hiking, especially in hotter months. Arizonaâ€™s dry climate can dehydrate you quickly, so drink small sips regularly rather than waiting until you're thirsty.</p>
        <h2>Start Early or Late</h2>
        <p>Avoid the midday heat by hiking early in the morning or later in the evening. The cooler parts of the day are safer and more enjoyable, especially during summer.</p>
        <h2>Wear Sun Protection</h2>
        <p>Use sunscreen with SPF 30+ and reapply every two hours. Wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and light, breathable clothing that covers your skin.</p>
        <h2>Watch the Weather</h2>
        <p>Check the forecast before your hike. Arizona can have sudden changes, and during monsoon season (July to September), thunderstorms and flash floods are possible. Avoid hiking if thereâ€™s a storm forecasted, especially in canyons.</p>
        <h2>Know the Trail and Your Limits</h2>
        <p>Choose a trail that matches your fitness and experience level, and research its difficulty, elevation, and estimated time to complete. Overestimating your ability on a challenging trail can lead to dangerous situations.</p>
        <h2>Use a Map or GPS</h2>
        <p>Familiarize yourself with the trail map and have a GPS or map app handy. Cell service can be spotty in remote areas, so consider downloading offline maps.</p>
        <h2>Carry Essentials</h2>
        <p>Bring a first aid kit, headlamp or flashlight, extra water, snacks, and a charged mobile phone. A pocketknife, whistle, and emergency blanket are also helpful in emergencies.</p>
        <h2>Pace Yourself</h2>
        <p>Arizonaâ€™s desert terrain can be rugged, with steep climbs and loose rocks. Take breaks often, pace yourself, and don't hesitate to turn back if youâ€™re tired or feel unwell.</p>
        <h2>Look Out for Wildlife</h2>
        <p>Watch for rattlesnakes, scorpions, and other wildlife. Keep a safe distance, stay on marked trails, and avoid putting your hands or feet in places you can't see.</p>
        <h2>Tell Someone Your Plan</h2>
        <p>Before you go, tell a friend or family member where you're hiking and when you expect to return. In remote areas, this can be a critical safety measure.</p>
